# Matala2 C++ Project

## Description
This repository hosts the Matala2 C++ Project, an educational and demonstrative initiative designed to deepen understanding of C++ programming among students and early-career software developers. The project features a series of programming tasks that focus on core aspects of C++ such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithm complexity, and memory management.

Each component of the project is crafted to challenge users to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, promoting a hands-on learning experience. Through detailed examples of algorithm implementation and data handling, participants can gain insights into:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Utilizing classes and objects to mimic real-world phenomena.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of various data structures like vectors, lists, and trees.
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Understanding how different algorithms operate under various constraints and how to optimize them for performance.
- **Memory Management**: Best practices for dynamic memory management using pointers and managing resources efficiently in a C++ environment.

The project is suitable for learners who are already familiar with the basics of programming and wish to advance their skills in C++ specifically. It is also a valuable resource for instructors seeking comprehensive examples to illustrate complex programming concepts in their curriculum.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC or Clang are recommended.
- **Build System**: Make (optional, but helpful for building projects).
- **IDE**: Any IDE that supports C++ (e.g., Visual Studio, CLion, or Eclipse CDT).

### Installing
